# Awesome Forth

[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

Forth is a stack-based, imperative and reflective programming language
that comes with its own interactive development environment. Forth is
famous (and infamous) for its extreme simplicity and flexibility. It
excels at the rapid prototyping of low-level software and and has been
implemented for an extremely wide range of platforms.
